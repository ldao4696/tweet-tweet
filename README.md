INFO 201 Final Project Requirements
- Create an interactive platform using R.  This could be a report, slideshow, or interactive visualization (preferably compiled into a 
  webpage for enhanced accessibility)
- Choose a dataset of sufficient complexity to explore.  This doesn't mean it has to be Big Data, but it should either be of notable size
 (more than a few hundred observations), or complexity (more than ~5 features of each observation)
- Demonstrate a nuanced understanding of the important features of the dataset.  High-level insights (important descriptive information, 
  major trends, notable outliers, etc.) should be prominent in your resource.  Statistical analyses may be included if appropriate
- Devise a visual representation of your data (i.e., chart, map, etc.).  Ideally, this should be an interactive visualization with ability
  to interact with the interface (hover, click, drag, etc.), or change the data being displayed (i.e., the chart responds to a set of 
  controls, such as which data is being displayed)
- Tailor your resource to a specific target audience.  The amount of framing you need to do for a scientific versus general audience is 
  quite different

Purpose:
By analyzing behavioral metrics, companies are better able to develop profiles of target segments. However, even with that capability,
effectively targeting high value sources of growth remains to be the largest problem in the marketing industry. With this in mind, we 
studied Twitterâ€™s data to produce an interactive visualization of the origin of tweets based on keywords and trends to make the data 
easier to understand and utilize for identifying the best sources of growth for a brand, product, or service. We have leveraged this 
data to plot and interpret key geographical locations, and better streamline analyses of potential markets for businesses.

Disclaimers:
- With the vast amount of data, the maps take a certain amount of time for our maps, charts, and graphs to render completely. We have 
  included notices on the Shiny app.
- Our data only pulls from users' tweets that have publicly allowed their data to be accessed.

Using Twitter's Public API

1. Did you receive any help from others (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who.
We received help from Michael Freeman and Landon Young.
2. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge?
Too many to keep count.
3. On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this challenge?
Different parts of the project varied in difficulty. It ranged from 4-8.
4. Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better?
We didn't encounter any major problems. Make sure students know to do thorough research before investing in a project and allocate 
enough time to get the project done.
